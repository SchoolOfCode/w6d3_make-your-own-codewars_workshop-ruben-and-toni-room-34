// The Roadmap for Father Christmas' deliveries

 
// Organise the destinations so that Father Christmas delivers the heaviest present first and spares his reindeers
// a back breaking night of carrying heavy loads all over the country...
// The second heaviest should be delivered second if it is in the same city as the heaviest, 
// otherwise deliver all presents in that city and 
// then move on to the next closest city.
// Cities are organised by alphabetical order "a" is near "b", "b" is near "c", "c" is near "d"... 
// Consider that "d" is nearer to "f" than it is to "a" and that he goes down the alphabet but not up the alphabet.
