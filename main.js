// Organise the destinations list for Father Christmas delivers base on the terms below.
//   - The heaviest present in the whole list will be delivered first and spares his rein deers
//     a back breaking night of carrying heavy loads all over the country...
//   - Father Christmas will continue delivering all the presents of the city where he started from heaviest to lightest.  
//   - After Father Christmas delivers all the presents in the first city, he will move to the next city following down alphabetic order A to Z, so
//    ex: list of cities(London, Birmingham, Southampton, Liverpool), if Father Christmas starts in London, the next city would be Southampton, 
//   - for the remainds cities that Santa did no cover, Father Christmas will continue following with the city starting the Alphabet again, Southampton => Birmingham;
//    so if Father Christmas starts in London the result list of the function should be organized like ( London => Southampton => Birmingham => Liverpool ).   
//   - Father Christmas will deleibery every presents in every city always following, first the heaviest and going down until the lightest.
